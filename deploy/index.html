		                Our tour guide, Sara, was very friendly and talkative. We enjoyed our ride to and from the volcano with her! We LOVED the mud bath and the massage was relaxing. It was a great experience all around. I highly recommend!

		                I would do this again! The pink sea is amazing and is really pink. The mud was warm and you don’t sink at all. Weird. The man cooking food by the lake makes fresh arepas that we’re the best ever! Highly recommended
