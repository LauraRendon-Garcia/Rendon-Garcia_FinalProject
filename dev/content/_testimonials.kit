    We did the half day tour and it was amazing!  Logistics and cost were great, safe driving by the wonderful Francisco and our guide David was a true native Colombian GEM!

    Our tour guide, Sara, was very friendly and talkative. We enjoyed our ride to and from the volcano with her! We LOVED the mud bath and the massage was relaxing. It was a great experience all around. I highly recommend!

    Got us great deals on boat rides out to Tiera Bomba, super helpful in taking our photos and just all around an amazing day. Book it!

    I would do this again! The pink sea is amazing and is really pink. The mud was warm and you don’t sink at all. Weird. The man cooking food by the lake makes fresh arepas that we’re the best ever! Highly recommended

    I had so much fun with my family. The kids were engaged and got to release their energy, and we got to enjoy the culture. We didn’t feel like parents taking our kids somewhere, we truly felt like we were on vacation.
